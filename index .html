The question of how computers can contribute to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic is being posed to experts in artificial intelligence (AI) all over the world.

AI tools can help in many different ways. They are being used to predict the spread of the coronavirus, map its genetic evolution as it transmits from human to human, speed up diagnosis, and in the development of potential treatments, while also helping policymakers cope with related issues, such as the impact on transport, food supplies and travel.

But in all these cases, AI is only effective if it has sufficient examples to learn from. As COVID-19 has taken the world into unchartered territory, the "deep learning" systems, which computers use to acquire new capabilities, don’t necessarily have the data they need to produce useful outputs.

“Deep learning is good at predicting generic behaviour, but is not very good at extrapolating that to a crisis situation when almost everything that happens is new,” cautions Leo Kärkkäinen, a professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation in Aalto University, Helsinki and a fellow with Nokia’s Bell Labs. “If people react in new ways, then AI cannot predict it. Until you have seen it, you cannot learn from it.”

Despite this caveat, Kärkkäinen says robust AI-based mathematical models are playing an important role in helping policymakers understand how COVID-19 is spreading and when the rate of infections is set to peak. “By drawing on data from the field, such as the number of deaths, AI models can help to detect how many infections are in the dark,” he adds, referring to undetected cases that are still infectious. That data can then be used to inform the establishment of quarantine zones and other social distancing measures.

It is also the case that AI-based diagnostics that are being applied in related areas can quickly be repurposed for diagnosing COVID-19 infections. Behold.ai, which has an algorithm for automatically detecting both lung cancer and collapsed lungs from X-rays, reported on Monday that the algorithm can quickly identify chest X-rays from COVID-19 patients as ‘abnormal’. This instant triage could potentially speed up diagnosis and ensure resources are allocated properly.

Identifying what’s working and what isn’t

The urgent need to understand what kinds of policy interventions are effective against COVID-19 has driven various governments to quickly award research grants to harness AI. One recipient is David Buckeridge, a professor in the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health at McGill University in Montreal. Armed with a grant of C$500,000 (€323,000), his team is combining natural language processing technology with machine learning tools, such as neural networks (a set of algorithms designed to recognise patterns), to analyse more than two million conventional media and social media reports about the spread of the coronavirus from all over the world. “This is unstructured free text – classical methods can’t deal with it,” Buckeridge said. “We want to extract a timeline from online media, that shows systematically what’s working where.”

The team at McGill is using a mixture of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to distil the key pieces of information from the online media reports. Supervised learning involves feeding a neural network with data that has been annotated, whereas unsupervised learning simply employs raw data. “We need a framework for bias – different media sources have a different perspective and there are different government controls,” says Buckeridge. “Humans are good at spotting that, but it needs to be built into the AI models.”

The information derived from the news reports will be combined with other data, such as COVID-19 case reports, to give policymakers and health authorities a much more complete picture of how and why the virus is spreading differently in different countries. “This is applied research in which we will look to get important answers fast,” Buckeridge noted. “We should have some results of relevance to public health in April.”
